# What am I seeing?

After `tilt up` successfully finished starting all the controllers, you should see something like this:

Tilt exposed two things for you. One, is the [frontend](../project-basics/high-level-components.mdx#frontend) and the other is the [receiver](../project-basics/high-level-components.mdx#receiver).

Let's take a look at the frontend. Without anything in the database, we should see
an empty view like this:

![kube-cluster](/img/empty-frontend.png)

It will change once we put the receiver to work. Namly, we send it an image to
process. Tilt uses port-forwarding to achieve this. If we would to do this manually
you could run something like this: `kubectl port-forward deployment/frontend 8081:8081`. Which forwards
the deployment, or perhaps a service like this `kubectl port-forward service/frontend 8081:8081`.

Your volume should contain a couple known images and some unknown images. Right now, the database
is primed using this file here: https://github.com/kube-project/kube-project/blob/main/requirements/requirements.yaml

This will create a ConfigMap in the system from which the database is seeded.

Alter these values if you wish to insert different named people and images:

~~~sql
    insert into person_images (image_name, person_id) values ('hannibal_1.jpg', 1);
    insert into person_images (image_name, person_id) values ('hannibal_2.jpg', 1);
    insert into person_images (image_name, person_id) values ('skarlso_1.jpg', 2);
    insert into person_images (image_name, person_id) values ('skarlso_2.jpg', 2);
    insert into person_images (image_name, person_id) values ('john_doe_1.jpg', 3);
    insert into person_images (image_name, person_id) values ('gergely_01.jpg', 4);
~~~

To mock about in the database, you need to create a shell on the database pod and run some mysql
commands directly.

~~~
# From the above pod-list we would like to execute a sql shell in the mysql pod.
kubectl exec -it mysql-6579bd84bc-bpc99 -- mysql -p
Enter password:

~~~

The password is `password123`. Now, we can run some sql commands, like show databases, select
one and then select some values.

~~~
mysql> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| kube               |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
+--------------------+
5 rows in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> use kube;
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed
mysql> show tables;
+----------------+
| Tables_in_kube |
+----------------+
| images         |
| person         |
| person_images  |
+----------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select * from person;
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
|  1 | Hannibal |
|  2 | Skarlso  |
|  3 | John Doe |
|  4 | Gergely  |
+----+----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql>
~~~

Now, let's send something to the receiver! To do that, use the following CURL format.

~~~
curl -XPOST -d '{"path": "/unknown_people/unknown_05.jpg"}' http://localhost:8000/image/post
got path: {Path:/unknown_people/unknown_05.jpg}
got paths: {Paths:[{Path:/unknown_people/unknown_05.jpg}]} with length: 1
image saved with id: 1
image sent to nsq
~~~

After this was successfully sent, we should see an entry in the database:

~~~
mysql> select * from images;
+----+--------------------------------+--------+--------+
| id | path                           | person | status |
+----+--------------------------------+--------+--------+
|  1 | /unknown_people/unknown_05.jpg |     -1 |      0 |
+----+--------------------------------+--------+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
~~~

Great! Let's check the frontend! We should see a single row in Pending. If
we weren't quick enough, that row would say processed and the person that matched
the person on the image, if any.

Pending:

![pending](/img/frontend-processing.png)

Processed:

![pending](/img/frontend-processed.png)

:::important
If nothing happens or you got an error for whatever reason, try looking at the pod logs
with the `logs` command like this:

~~~
kubectl logs receiver-deployment-7fcf6f77d7-5rx6r
