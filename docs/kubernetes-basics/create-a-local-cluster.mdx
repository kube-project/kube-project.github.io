# Create a Local Cluster

Instead of reading endless lines of documentation to understand the basics of Kubernetes, this guide is trying to be
more hands-on.

We will start by creating a cluster. We will create this cluster locally and not use any cloud providers.

:::important
A local cluster will be different from a cloud based cluster in many ways. Load Balancer, persistent volumes, networking
and routing will be different. You don't have to concern yourself with that for now. Just remember, this here, we are
trying to get to know the building blocks.
