# Assumption About the environment

This guide assumes that the following things are available in the environment:

- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- *nix* environment

This guide isn't aiming to be a complete and utter description of Kubernetes. That's already done in many other places.
[kodekloud](https://kodekloud.com/) does an insane job on that already. I encourage you to enroll.
